# Agentic Exploration Example
# This workflow uses Claude Code's full tool capabilities to explore the codebase
#
# The key configuration is in agentic_loop:
#   - allowed_paths: Directories where tools can operate
#   - tools: Optional whitelist of allowed tools (default: all)
#
# Without allowed_paths, Claude Code runs in --print mode (output only)
# With allowed_paths, Claude Code can use Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep tools

    Explore this codebase and provide a brief summary. Use your tools to:
    1. List the top-level directory structure
    2. Read the main entry point (main.go or similar)
    3. Summarize what this project does

    When you have enough information, output "DONE" to exit the loop.
  output: STDOUT
