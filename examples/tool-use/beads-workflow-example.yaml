# Beads Workflow Example
# This example demonstrates how to use the 'bd' (beads) tool to list issues
# and generate a summary workflow.
#
# SECURITY NOTE: Tool use allows shell command execution. Only run workflows
# from trusted sources. Commands are subject to allowlist/denylist controls.

# Step 1: List all beads issues using the bd tool
list_beads:
  input: "tool: bd list --json"
  model: NA
  action:
    - Pass through the JSON data without modification
  output: STDOUT
  tool:
    allowlist:
      - bd
    timeout: 30

# Alternative example: Use tool with filtering
# This pipes STDIN through a grep command to filter results
# list_filtered_beads:
#   input: "tool: bd list"
#   model: NA
#   action:
#     - Pass through the data
#   output: "STDOUT|grep -i 'open'"
#   tool:
#     allowlist:
#       - bd
#       - grep
